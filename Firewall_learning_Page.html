                        A firewall is a network security device. It can be hardware or software-based, and it's used to
                        monitor traffic based on the security rules it accepts, rejects, or drops.

                        Overall, a firewall acts as a wall to protect local computers. It does so by gating the borders
                        of private networks or devices.

                    <h1 class="section-title">How does it work?</h1>
                    <p class="reading-text">
                        Firewalls match the networks' traffic against the rules defined in their table. These rules
                        define those who can and cannot access such data. When the rule is matched, its consequential
                        action follows (Accept, Reject, or Drop). Although firewalls can examine outgoing traffic, it's
                        often that the incoming traffic is inspected. The traffic, when reached the firewall, is
                        addressed upon the three major Transport Layer protocols - TCP, UDP, and ICMP. TCP and UDP use
                        ports numbers, while ICMP uses a type code.

                            Packet Filtering Firewall<br>
                            A firewall that compares the outgoing and incoming network packets through a set of
                            established rules such as the allowed IP address, IP protocol, and port numbers.

                            This is a variation of the Pact Filtering Firewall. It not only examines each network packet
                            but also checks if that packet is part of the established network connection. This firewall
                            is also known as Dynamic Packet Filtering Firewall.

                            Also known as Application Level Gateway, prevents the direct connection between either side
                            of the firewall. it does so by filtering the packets on any OSI layer, even up to the
                            application layer. It has the ability to block certain content and recognize when certain
                            applications are being misused.
