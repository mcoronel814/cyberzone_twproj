                    <h1 class="section-title">What is Android Rooting?</h1>
                    <p class="reading-text">
                        Android Rooting is when the owner of an Android device wants to have the root privilege of said
                        device. These are normally people who want to make certain customizations to their devices.
                        Android Rotting is similar to JAIL Break for IOS devices and is done by skillful people.<br>
                        <br>
                        Rooting gives Android users the ability to deeply customize their devices, modify software, and
                        change the level of security the device possesses. Android works on a Linux Distribution System.
                        Therefore, the applications on the device are restricted to certain abilities as they're given a
                        UID (Unique User ID). Rooting allows the user to gain root access to the application to be able
                        to bypass this restriction.<br>

                    <h1 class="section-title">How does Rooting affect the Phone?</h1>
                    <p class="reading-text">
                        When rooting, the user adds a binary and an app to manage it. This is done by installing a
                        third-party application that'll execute the root on the device. Here a file called SU is placed
                        in the system. This stands for Switch User and it grants permission so that the .normal user
                        would become a superuser. Applications like Kinguser and Superuser are more well-known apps that
                        can do this.

                    <h1 class="section-title">Why Rooting can be Bad</h1>
                    <p class="reading-text">
                        Rooting makes it easier to attack one's device. This is so as it's an open door for malicious
                        malware to be injected into said device. Hackers can access users' information via the device's
                        credentials and can use this data at their convenience. Knowing this, one needs to install a VPN
                        or Anti-Virus protection to secure their data.
