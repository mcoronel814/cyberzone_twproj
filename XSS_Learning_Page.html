            <p class="reading-text">
              Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common and
              vulnerable attacks. XSS is an attack where malicious code is
              injected into a website and is used to harm the victim’s browser.
              The purpose of this attack is to steal the victim’s identity data.
              In most cases, the scripts are used to steal the users’ cookies as
              they help users automatically log into the site. XSS is a
              client-side attack, meaning that the victims are the unsuspecting
              visitors of the site.

            <h1 class="section-title">Types of XSS</h1>
            <p class="reading-text">
              The three main categories of XSS are Reflected XSS, Stored XSS,
              and DOM.
              <div class="reading-bullet-list">
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                Reflective XSS occurs when the results of a malicious script are
                being returned to the website. This type of XSS is not saved
                permanently. An example of this is a website where the victim as
                a login. The attacker can insert a script which will return the
                victim’s login information so that they can used it at their
                convenience. This code can also be included in fake url or HTTP
                parameters.
              </li>
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                Stored XSS is when the malicious script is being saved on the
                webserver. Therefore, its executed whenever the users calls the
                appropriate functionality. This affects users on a larger scale
                because its able to to attack multiple users at the same time.
                In addition, because the script is saved on the webserver, it’ll
                cause longterm damage. This type of XSS is performed by
                inserting the malicious script via a vulnerable inout. By doing
                this, the script will be saved in te database and executed
                whenever the appropriate function is called.
              </li>
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                DOM-based attacks are also called client-side XSS. DOm stands
                for, and instead of attacking the web server, the scripts are
                used to modify the user’s browser. In this attack, the script is
                sent as a parameter. Therefore, that script will be used to
                create a page by the browser where the users can insert their
                information. Then that information will be sent to the attacker.
