          <h1 class="section-title">What is Cross Site Scripting?</h1>
          <p class="reading-text">
            Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common and
            vulnerable attacks. XSS is an attack where malicious code is
            injected into a website and is used to harm the victim’s browser.
            The purpose of this attack is to steal the victim’s identity data.
            In most cases, the scripts are used to steal the users’ cookies as
            they help users automatically log into the site. XSS is a
            client-side attack, meaning that the victims are the unsuspecting
            visitors of the site.

          <h1 class="section-title">How is XSS performed?</h1>
          <p class="reading-text">
            XSS is usually performed using client-side programming languages. The most popular languages used to perform
            this are HTML and Javascript, but others include VBCript, Flask, etc. There are many ways that XSS presents
            itself. The malicious script can be reflected on the victim’s browser, or stored in a database and executed
            whenever the user uses the website. This attack is harmful because the attacker can inject the script into
            an unsuspecting website’s code. From there, the user’s browser will not be able to recognize that script as
            malicious as it's now seen as a part of the website’s code. Some of the main forms of XSS include:
            <div class="reading-bullet-list">
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                Malicious script is executed on the client-side.
              </li>
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                A fake page where a user may provide their credentials or click on a malicious link.
              </li>
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                Can be displayed on websites as advertisements.
              </li>
              <li class="reading-bullet">
                Can be sent as an email to the victim.
              </li>
            </div>

          <h1 class="section-title">Types of XSS</h1>
          <p class="reading-text">
            The three main categories of XSS are Reflected XSS, Stored XSS,
            and DOM.
          <div class="reading-bullet-list">
            <li class="reading-bullet">
              Reflective XSS occurs when the results of a malicious script are
              being returned to the website. This type of XSS is not saved
              permanently. An example of this is a website where the victim as
              a login. The attacker can insert a script which will return the
              victim’s login information so that they can used it at their
              convenience. This code can also be included in fake url or HTTP
              parameters.
            </li>
            <li class="reading-bullet">
              Stored XSS is when the malicious script is being saved on the
              webserver. Therefore, its executed whenever the users calls the
              appropriate functionality. This affects users on a larger scale
              because its able to to attack multiple users at the same time.
              In addition, because the script is saved on the webserver, it’ll
              cause longterm damage. This type of XSS is performed by
              inserting the malicious script via a vulnerable inout. By doing
              this, the script will be saved in te database and executed
              whenever the appropriate function is called.
            </li>
            <li class="reading-bullet">
              DOM-based attacks are also called client-side XSS. DOM stands
              for Document Object Model, and instead of attacking the web server, the scripts are
              used to modify the user’s browser. In this attack, the script is
              sent as a parameter. Therefore, that script will be used to
              create a page by the browser where the users can insert their
              information. Then that information will be sent to the attacker.
